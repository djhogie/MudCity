#AWS Steps
#Log into AWS and search for "Cloudformation"
#Click "Create Stack" (with new resources)
#"Upload a template file" >> "Choose file" Select the "awsworkingcode" file I sent you >> "Next" (at the bottom)
#Under "Stack name" call it whatever you want, i.e. "MC-WebStack" >> "Next"
#Press "Next" again at the bottom of this screen
#Go to the bottom of this screen and check the box for "I acknowledge that AWS Cloudformation might create IAM resources"
#"Create Stack"
#All of the resources will start to deploy, networking resources, firewalls, routers, Server, Public IP etc...
#To delete everything when you are done, go back to Cloudformation and select the stack then "Delete" ez pz
#Get familiar with deleting it, and re-creating it. You should only be running this stuff when you are using it, or when you need the website to be running. The biggest costs will be running the server/Public IP


#Connecting to your Web Server
#search for EC2 >> instances >> check the box for instances >> "Connect" (located on the top right) then connect via SSM, you will then be logged into the server on a web browser terminal
